### **05-Leap Year**

A year is a leep year

- if it is evenly divisible by 4;
- except if that year is also evenly divisible by 100;
- unless that year is also divisible by 400.

e.g.  
2000 / 4 = 500 (Leap)  
2000 / 100 = 20 (Not Leap)  
2000 / 400 = 5 (Leap)  
--> 2000 is a leap year

2100 / 4 525 (Leap)  
2100 / 100 = 21 (Not Leap)  
2100 / 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)  
--> 2100 not a leap year

e.g., test with: 1896 (Leap) - 1900 (Not Leap) - 1904 (Leap)
